DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP game_inst/sprite_addr0 input game_inst/sprite_addr0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning

DSP game_inst/sprite_addr0__0 input game_inst/sprite_addr0__0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP game_inst/sprite_addr0__0 input game_inst/sprite_addr0__0/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#4 Warning

DSP game_inst/sprite_addr1 input game_inst/sprite_addr1/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#5 Warning

DSP game_inst/sprite_addr1__0 input game_inst/sprite_addr1__0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP game_inst/sprite_addr0 output game_inst/sprite_addr0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>
